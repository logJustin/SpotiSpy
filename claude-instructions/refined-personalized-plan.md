# 🎵 Refined Daily Spotify Wrapped Plan

## 🎯 Personalized Approach Based on Your Preferences

### Your Key Interests (Prioritized)
1. **Overall listening trends** - You enjoy tracking total music consumption
2. **Artist deep dives** - Cool to see top artist listening patterns  
3. **Album focus sessions** - Special insights for when you sink into specific albums
4. **Visual elements** - Charts and graphs to make data engaging
5. **Weekly summaries** - Sunday wrap-ups of the entire week
6. **Fun but not excessive tone** - Playful messages without going overboard

### Technical Constraints & Preferences
- Start with existing data (don't need Spotify API immediately)
- Add database fields gradually as needed
- TDD approach: Plan → Tests → Implementation
- Phase-based development for manageable progress

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Strategy

### Simplified Data Analysis (No API Calls Initially)

#### 1. **Enhanced Data Processing**
```python
# Use existing data creatively
def analyze_listening_patterns(day_data):
    return {
        'album_sessions': detect_album_binges(day_data),
        'artist_domination': calculate_artist_percentages(day_data), 
        'listening_consistency': analyze_hourly_distribution(day_data),
        'focus_sessions': detect_continuous_listening(day_data)
    }

def detect_album_binges(songs):
    """Find when 3+ songs from same album played in sequence"""
    album_sequences = []
    current_sequence = []
    
    for song in songs:
        if current_sequence and song['album'] == current_sequence[-1]['album']:
            current_sequence.append(song)
        else:
            if len(current_sequence) >= 3:
                album_sequences.append(current_sequence)
            current_sequence = [song]
    
    return album_sequences
```

#### 2. **ASCII Chart Generator**
```python
def create_weekly_chart(daily_durations, max_width=10):
    """Create simple ASCII bar chart"""
    max_duration = max(daily_durations)
    chart_lines = []
    
    for day, duration in daily_durations.items():
        bar_width = int((duration / max_duration) * max_width)
        bar = "█" * bar_width + "░" * (max_width - bar_width)
        chart_lines.append(f"  {day[:3]} {bar}  {format_duration(duration)}")
    
    return "\n".join(chart_lines)
```

#### 3. **Weekly Data Aggregation**
```python
def generate_weekly_summary():
    """Run every Sunday to summarize the past week"""
    week_data = get_last_7_days_data()
    
    summary = {
        'total_time': sum_weekly_listening_time(week_data),
        'top_artists': get_top_weekly_artists(week_data),
        'album_binges': find_weekly_album_sessions(week_data),
        'daily_pattern': analyze_weekly_patterns(week_data),
        'records_broken': check_personal_records(week_data)
    }
    
    return format_weekly_message(summary)
```

## 🎭 Message Tone Guidelines

### Fun But Not Excessive Examples

#### ✅ Good Balance
```
🎵 Your music hit different today! 
4h 23m of pure vibes across 87 songs.
The Weeknd really had you in a chokehold (28% of your day) 🎤
```

#### ✅ Playful Discovery
```
💿 Album binge alert! 
Looks like "AM" by Arctic Monkeys was the perfect soundtrack 
for whatever you were working on (42 straight minutes!)
```

#### ❌ Too Much
```
OMG BESTIE! 🤩🎉 Your music taste is LITERALLY fire today! 🔥🔥🔥 
The Weeknd said "I'm gonna DOMINATE this playlist" and he DID THAT! 💅✨
We stan a consistent listener! Period! 💯🙌
```

### Tone Principles
- **Observational**: "Looks like...", "Seems like...", "Today was a..."
- **Mildly celebratory**: "Nice!", "Solid choice", "Good vibes"  
- **Conversational**: Reference patterns like they're interesting discoveries
- **Occasional humor**: Light jokes about obvious patterns, not forced

## 🧪 TDD Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Structure First

#### 1. **Test Data Setup**
```python
# tests/fixtures/sample_data.py
def create_sample_daily_data():
    """Create realistic sample listening data"""
    return [
        {
            'song': 'Blinding Lights', 'artist': 'The Weeknd', 
            'album': 'After Hours', 'played_at': '2025-03-15T10:30:00Z',
            'duration': 200.5
        },
        # More realistic test data...
    ]

def create_weeknd_album_binge():
    """Data representing someone deep-diving The Weeknd"""
    return [
        {'song': 'Alone Again', 'artist': 'The Weeknd', 'album': 'After Hours'},
        {'song': 'Too Late', 'artist': 'The Weeknd', 'album': 'After Hours'},
        {'song': 'Hardest To Love', 'artist': 'The Weeknd', 'album': 'After Hours'},
        # 5+ consecutive songs from same album
    ]
```

#### 2. **Test-First Feature Development**
```python
# tests/test_album_binge_detection.py
def test_detects_album_binge():
    """Test that 3+ consecutive songs from same album = binge"""
    binge_data = create_weeknd_album_binge()
    result = detect_album_binges(binge_data)
    
    assert len(result) == 1
    assert result[0]['album'] == 'After Hours'
    assert result[0]['song_count'] >= 3

def test_ignores_single_songs():
    """Random songs shouldn't trigger binge detection"""
    mixed_data = create_mixed_playlist_data() 
    result = detect_album_binges(mixed_data)
    
    assert len(result) == 0
```

#### 3. **Message Formatting Tests**
```python
# tests/test_message_formatting.py
def test_weekly_chart_generation():
    """Test ASCII chart creation"""
    daily_data = {'Mon': 3.2, 'Tue': 4.1, 'Wed': 1.8}
    chart = create_weekly_chart(daily_data)
    
    assert 'Mon' in chart
    assert '█' in chart  # Has filled bars
    assert '░' in chart  # Has empty bars
    assert chart.count('\n') == 2  # 3 lines total

def test_tone_appropriateness():
    """Ensure messages aren't too over-the-top"""
    sample_insights = create_sample_insights()
    message = format_daily_message(sample_insights)
    
    # Should be fun but not excessive
    emoji_count = message.count('🎵') + message.count('🎤') + message.count('💿')
    assert emoji_count <= 8  # Reasonable emoji usage
    
    excessive_phrases = ['OMG', 'BESTIE', 'LITERALLY', 'PERIODT']
    for phrase in excessive_phrases:
        assert phrase not in message.upper()
```
