# 🎵 SpotiSpy Development Log

## 📋 Current Status & Roadmap

### Recently Completed ✅
- **Overhaul Pt1** - Clean 5-file architecture (`spotify.py`, `database.py`, `analysis.py`, `messages.py`, `helpers.py`)
- **Butler Feature** - Digital archivist personality with 10 randomized Ready Player One inspired greetings
- **ASCII Charts** - Visual charts in daily messages (genre breakdown, weekly patterns, discovery ratio, social trends)
- **Script & Time Fixes** - Fixed broken `write_recent_song.sh`, corrected timezone handling (CST→CDT), added 12-hour AM/PM time display

### Next Priority: Phase 1 Daily Features 📋
Missing features for daily summaries according to refined plan:

1. **Album Binge Detection** - Detect 3+ consecutive songs from same album
2. **Artist Domination Analysis** - Calculate percentages and highlight dominant artists  
3. **Listening Streaks** - Count consecutive listening days
4. **Enhanced Trends** - Week averages, yesterday comparisons
5. **Artist Journey Timeline** - Morning/afternoon/evening artist breakdown

### Phase 2: Weekly Sunday Summary 🔮
- Sunday "Weekly Wrapped" messages
- Week-over-week comparisons  
- Weekly pattern analysis
- Streak tracking

## 📅 Development Sessions

### August 8, 2025

#### Session Start: 9:XX AM
**Goal:** Continue where we left off after ASCII charts implementation

**Analysis:**
- Reviewed recent commits showing ASCII charts were successfully implemented
- Located comprehensive planning docs (`refined-personalized-plan.md`, `tdd-implementation-guide.md`)
- Identified missing daily summary features from Phase 1 plan
- Created this development log to track progress

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Enhanced daily summaries with Ready Player One character personas
- ✅ Added 6 unique character personalities (Parzival, Aech, Art3mis, Halliday, Sorrento, Ogden)
- ✅ Integrated Giphy API for character GIFs/images
- ✅ Added character-specific commentary for each section:
  - Listening stats with time-based reactions
  - Mood/energy analysis with personality-driven insights  
  - Top hits commentary on repeat behavior
  - Peak activity with time-of-day observations
  - ASCII charts introduction and closing messages
- ✅ Added authentic character references and quotes:
  - Parzival: Copper Key, First Gate, WarGames, "Tempest", gunter terminology
  - Aech: Iron Giant, Rush, garage/workshop references, racing
  - Art3mis: Jade Key, blog posts, Chthonia, real name mystery
  - Halliday: GSS coding, Easter eggs, OASIS creation, "Thank you for playing"
  - Sorrento: IOI corporate speak, loyalty center, analytics division
  - Ogden: Kira references, GSS history, "I suppose we were friends"

#### Session Continue: Time/Script Fixes
**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed broken `write_recent_song.sh` script (was calling non-existent `scripts.download.fetch_and_upload`)
- ✅ Updated script to correctly run `main.py` 
- ✅ Fixed timezone handling - corrected CST (UTC-6) to CDT (UTC-5) for current daylight saving time
- ✅ Added proper timezone conversion in `database.py` - now converts UTC timestamps to Central Time before grouping by hour
- ✅ Added 12-hour time format with AM/PM display in messages (e.g. "5:00 PM" instead of "17:00")
- ✅ Created `format_hour_12h()` function for time conversion in messages

**Status:** Script functionality restored, timezone issues resolved, time display improved

**Next Steps:**
- Test enhanced summaries with real data
- Implement missing analytical features (album binge, artist domination, streaks)
- Begin Phase 2 weekly summary implementation

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Test-Driven Development Approach
Following the established TDD pattern:
1. Write tests first
2. Implement minimum viable feature
3. Refactor and enhance
4. Integrate with existing message formatting

### Code Architecture
- Core logic in `spotispy/analysis.py`
- Message formatting in `spotispy/messages.py`  
- Tests in `tests/` with fixtures in `conftest.py`
- Database queries in `spotispy/database.py`

### Message Tone Guidelines
- Fun but not excessive
- Observational: "Looks like...", "Seems like..."
- Mildly celebratory: "Nice!", "Solid choice"
- Conversational discovery references
- Reasonable emoji usage (≤8 per message)
